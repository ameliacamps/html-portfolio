<hr/>
<h3> Honorable Mention </h3>
<h4> Pluto (2023)</h4>
<p>A Netflix limited series beginning as a murder mystery in a world where sentient robots live alongside humans. As the plot unfolds into an action-driven story, it probes deep philosophical themes: war, ethics, and what it means to be human; ultimately challenging viewers to reconsider legal and moral responsibilities toward sentient life. It is both incredible and devasting and is one of those pieces of media you only watch once but stays with you for the rest of your life.</p>
