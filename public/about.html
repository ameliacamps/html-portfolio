<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Amèlia Camps-McCaffrey — a Graphic & Web Designer, Digital Marketer, and Social Media Specialist with a passion for storytelling through design. I create impactful visuals and campaigns that connect brands to their audiences. Whether building a brand from scratch, optimizing digital experiences, or managing multi-channel marketing, I bring creative strategy and thoughtful design to every project.</p>

<p>I began my graphic design journey because I was searching for a creative outlet that allowed me to bring my ideas to life, even when traditional drawing and painting didn’t come naturally to me. While I found art class challenging in my early years, those experiences motivated me to explore new ways to express myself visually. With my first smartphone, a hand me down iPhone 3, I downloaded a background erasing app and for the first time I could actually create what I envisioned in my mind. I never looked back.</p>
